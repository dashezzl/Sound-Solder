The installation inscribes itself in the tradition of the Synthesizer Do It Yourself (SDIY) scene and is based on its knowledge. The aim of the installation is to give insight into the world of homemade electronic instruments. The community ÃÅs mode of practice relies on constant re-creation and enhancement, therefore our installation is able to recreate and expand itself by etching new circuit boards. The work provides detailed instructions and all the necessary plans to rebuild it. What makes this installation particular is that it emphasizes iteration as a key element in the SDIY community. Not only did we based it on replicating existing open source designs, but the elements of the installation are multiplying themselves by re-creating and expanding their working parts by etching new circuit boards.
